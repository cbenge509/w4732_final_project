%%%%%%%%% ABSTRACT
\begin{abstract}
In this paper, we present a novel approach to improving facial keypoint detection performance by combining image augmentation techniques, stacked generalization of weak learners, and exploitation of diverse training data subsets via targeted splitting of data preparation and training pipelines.  Our methodology entails careful data preprocessing, including thorough cleaning of provided images and labels to ensure high-quality training data is available to all learners.  Further, We leverage a stacked ensemble architecture comprising multiple simple neural networks, each trained on a subset of the data arranged by different data organizers, with a final linear meta-model that utilizes multiplication-based feature interactions for the final prediction.  This approach resulted in a final RMSE of 1.28637, good for second place in a Kaggle competition and only 0.004 RMSE off from a tie for first place.\footnote{Solution available on GitHub: \href{https://github.com/cbenge509/w4732_final_project}{cbenge509 - W4732 Final Project}}
